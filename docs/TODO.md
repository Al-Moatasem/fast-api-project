# Ideas
- For endpoints with pagination, add to the response (body or header) a url to the next page.
  - Make sure that the next page will have data in its response
- Requests that took more than `n` minutes should be terminated.
- Tests
  - Testing endpoints
    - test the status code for the response
    - test the schema of the response body
    - test the content of the response body
  - Either create a testing database, or test on the production :(, but any write action (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) has to be fixed
  - Testing users
    - create a user
    - user login
      - regular endpoint tests
      - validate the token, user id in the token matches the user id in the response (in case of the schema includes the user id), the token type (bearer)
      - test successful login and failed login
      - test multiple scenarios valid email/pass, valid email/invalid pass, invalid email/pass, missing email/valid pass, valid email/missing pass
    - endpoints that require token
      - create two pytest fixtures
        - generates a valid token
        - create an authorized client to be used instead of `client = TestClient()`
      - test if unauthorized user has access to a protected endpoint
